# aoc2023 -- My solutions for Advent of Code 2023


This repo contains my solutions for the 2023 Advent of Code calendar puzzles.  

While it seems silly, I'm explicitly licensing these solutions under the 0BSD
license, so anyone may do whatever they want with them. I would ask that no one
uses them to get solutions quickly to get a place on the Leaderboard of AoC but

1. I'm nowhere near fast enough to get a place on the Leaderboard even for
   myself :)
2. Even if by some miracle I'll be fast enough to get onto the Leaderboard,
   I'll only push my code to this remote repository when the Leaderboard is
   already full.
